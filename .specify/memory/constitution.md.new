# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Hardware-Software Integration
Every feature must account for both hardware and software components; Systems must be designed with real-time constraints, sensor fusion, and actuator coordination in mind; Clear interfaces required between perception, planning, and control layers.

### II. Simulation-First Development
All algorithms must be validated in simulation before physical robot deployment; Use Gazebo/Unity digital twins for testing; Ensure sim-to-real transfer capability with physics accuracy considerations.

### III. Test-First Robotics (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory for all robotic systems: Tests written → Safety verified → Tests pass in simulation → Then deploy on physical robot; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced with safety checks.

### IV. Safety-First Architecture
All robotic behaviors must include safety constraints and emergency stop mechanisms; Collision avoidance and human-safe operations required; Fail-safe modes must be implemented for all autonomous behaviors.

### V. Modularity & Reusability
Robot behaviors and algorithms must be modular and reusable across different robot platforms; Component-based architecture with standardized interfaces; Clear separation between perception, planning, and control.

### VI. Real-Time Performance
All systems must meet real-time performance requirements; Latency constraints for sensor processing and actuator commands; Deterministic behavior for safety-critical functions.

## Technical Standards
<!-- Technology stack requirements for ROS2, Isaac Sim, Gazebo, Python/C++, etc. -->

All code must follow ROS2 standards and conventions; Use rclpy for Python nodes and rclcpp for C++ nodes; URDF models for robot representation; Standard message types and services for inter-component communication.

## Development Workflow
<!-- Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process for robot code -->

All robot code must be tested in simulation environment before physical deployment; Peer review required for all changes affecting robot autonomy; Incremental deployment with safety supervisors present; Logging and monitoring required for all robot behaviors.

## Governance

All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with safety requirements; Complexity must be justified with clear benefits to robot capabilities; Use robotics-specific guidelines for development and deployment.
