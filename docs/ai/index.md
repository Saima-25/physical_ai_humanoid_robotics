# AI for Robotics

This section explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, focusing on how AI techniques enable intelligent behavior in robotic systems.

## Overview

Artificial Intelligence in robotics involves applying machine learning, computer vision, planning, and decision-making algorithms to enable robots to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. This field combines the physical embodiment of robots with intelligent algorithms to create autonomous systems.

## Key AI Areas in Robotics

1. **Perception**: How robots understand their environment using sensors
2. **Planning**: How robots decide what actions to take
3. **Control**: How robots execute actions effectively
4. **Learning**: How robots improve their performance over time

## Core Technologies

### Machine Learning
Machine learning algorithms enable robots to learn from experience and adapt to new situations. Key applications include:
- Object recognition and classification
- Path planning and navigation
- Manipulation and grasping
- Human-robot interaction

### Computer Vision
Computer vision allows robots to interpret visual information from cameras and other sensors. This is crucial for:
- Object detection and tracking
- Scene understanding
- Visual servoing
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning provides a framework for robots to learn optimal behaviors through interaction with the environment. This is particularly useful for:
- Motor control and locomotion
- Task learning
- Adaptive behavior

## Learning Path

This section is structured to build your understanding progressively:

2. [Computer Vision for Robotics](./computer-vision-robotics.md) - Visual perception in robotic systems

## Simulation-First Approach

Following our constitution principle, we emphasize training and testing AI algorithms in simulation before deployment on real hardware. This allows for safer experimentation and faster iteration cycles.

## Safety Considerations

When implementing AI in robotics:
- Consider the safety implications of learned behaviors
- Implement proper validation and testing procedures
- Design for graceful degradation when AI systems fail
- Ensure transparency and interpretability where possible
