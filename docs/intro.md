# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This documentation covers the fundamental concepts, practical implementations, and cutting-edge research in the field of robotics, with a particular focus on humanoid systems.

## What You'll Learn

This guide is structured to take you from basic concepts to advanced implementations in robotics:

- **Robotics Fundamentals**: Understanding ROS2, nodes, topics, services, and robot description (URDF)
- **Digital Twins**: Creating simulation environments with Gazebo and Unity
- **AI Integration**: Applying computer vision, machine learning, and planning to robotics
- **Humanoid Systems**: Control systems, locomotion, and manipulation for humanoid robots
- **Safety & Best Practices**: Critical safety considerations for robotics development

## Target Audience

This documentation is designed for:
- Robotics engineers and researchers
- AI/ML practitioners interested in robotics applications
- Students studying robotics or AI
- Developers working with humanoid robot platforms
- Anyone interested in the intersection of AI and physical systems

## Getting Started

Each section builds upon the previous, but you can also dive into specific topics based on your interests:

1. Start with [Robotics Fundamentals](./robotics/index.md) if you're new to ROS2 and robot systems
2. Explore [AI for Robotics](./ai/index.md) to understand how machine learning applies to robotics
3. Dive into [Simulation](./simulation/index.md) to learn about digital twin technology
4. Study [Humanoid Robotics](./humanoid/index.md) for advanced humanoid-specific content

## Simulation-First Approach

Following our core principle of "simulation-first development", we emphasize understanding concepts through simulation before considering real hardware. This approach allows for safer experimentation and faster iteration.

## Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate through the documentation. Each section contains theoretical concepts, practical examples, and links to related topics.
