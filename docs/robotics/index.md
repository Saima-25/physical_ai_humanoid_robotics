# Robotics Fundamentals

This section covers the fundamental concepts of robotics, focusing on the Robot Operating System (ROS2) and its application in humanoid robotics systems.

## Overview

Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and other disciplines to design, construct, operate, and use robotic systems. In this section, we'll explore the core concepts that form the foundation of modern robotics development.

## Core Components of Robotics

1. **Sensing**: How robots perceive their environment
2. **Planning**: How robots decide what actions to take
3. **Actuation**: How robots execute physical actions
4. **Control**: How robots coordinate their actions over time

## Key Technologies

### ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)
ROS2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms and environments.

### Why ROS2?
- **Modularity**: Components can be developed and tested independently
- **Community**: Large ecosystem of packages and tools
- **Simulation**: Strong integration with simulation environments
- **Real-time capabilities**: Improved real-time performance over ROS1
- **Security**: Built-in security features for industrial applications

## Learning Path

This section is structured to build your understanding progressively:

1. [ROS2 Basics](./ros2-basics.md) - Introduction to ROS2 concepts
2. [Nodes, Topics, and Services](./nodes-topics-services.md) - Core communication patterns
3. [rclpy Introduction](./rclpy-intro.md) - Python client library for ROS2
4. [URDF Fundamentals](./urdf-fundamentals.md) - Unified Robot Description Format

## Simulation-First Approach

Following our constitution principle, we emphasize simulation before hardware implementation. This allows for safer testing and faster iteration cycles during development.
